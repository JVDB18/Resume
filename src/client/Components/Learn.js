            <h3>Passions</h3>
When I’m not banging my head against some code, you will find me with a pen and a piece of sheet, I’ve made my college education in art and still like to spend time creating illustrations, painting or writing.

Passionate about ocean, nature and wildlife hiking and diving also take a great part in my life. I am strongly involved in marine conservation since my first diving trip and totally fell in love with the philosophy, sensation and mindset of this discipline.
            <h3>Some facts  about me</h3>
    <p>I can be stubborn as hell. I play video games since my dad showed me Diablo back to 1997. I loved Star Wars's prequel (I know, nobody is perfect...). I prefer Stargate over Battlestar Galactica. Pineapple on pizza doesn't bother me. My friends thinks I have the sense of humor of a kid. A simple smile can make my whole day. I'm a Pomodoro and Deep work adept, team work, curiosity and resourcefulness are essential to me. I have a cocker spaniel named Tania but everyone calls her Big Butt, and finally I recently discovered hackatons, challenging myself in those events were an incredible experience, now I'm addict.</p>
